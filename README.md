# TSPProblem

The program finds the shortest Hamiltonian path in four ways and compares them.
Ways of finding: brute force, random search, annealing imitation method, greedy. The parameters for which the comparison was made: the average length of the path, the standard deviation is sigma, the confidence interval.

For the test, enter the number of tests. Time strongly depends on the number of tests!
